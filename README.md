A real-time scheduling app that emphasizes human interaction through group availability and event coordination making group planning effortless. This was built for the Jan 2026 United Hackathon \\ V6.

## **Note:**

I didn't have much time to work on this during the hackathon due to external factors otherwise I would of loved to participate further, so this may be a project I work on in the future. But I will be submitting it in its current state.
